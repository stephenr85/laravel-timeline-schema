/**
 * registry-kernel ticket 74 — this package's composing registries forward the pushed authorizer into
 * the {@see BasicRegistry} they hold.
 *
 * ## Behavioural, never reflective
 *
 * Both wrong numbers ticket 74 corrected came from reflection probes: one read `MISSING` without asking
 * why, the other read through an accessor that nulls the authorizer by design and reported 55 missing of
 * 64. So this installs a deny-all authorizer against an ability-carrying entry and reads the registry's
 * own public surface — the consequence, not the field.
 *
 * The probe is seeded through the composed store because the outer `register()` signatures narrow their
 * key and entry types per registry; the ASSERTION is entirely through the public read.
